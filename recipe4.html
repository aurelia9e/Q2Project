              <p>MAIN INGREDIENTS:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Condensed milk</li>
                <li>Evaporated milk</li>
                <li>Lime zest</li>
                <li>Sugar and water</li>
                <li>Unflavored powdered gelatin</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <p>For the caramel:</p>
                <li>As the sugar is not melted over the stovetop and is instead caramelized in the microwave, you can use ceramic or glass ramekins to steam or bake the flan.</li>
                <li></li>
                <li>Microwave wattages vary, so adjust the time accordingly. Add half-minute increments as needed until the caramel reaches a honey-gold color.</li>
                <li>The sugar can burn fast in the microwave, making it bitter tasting. Keep a close eye, especially when the liquid starts to brown.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Break and stir the eggs first with the condensed milk until there are no more white streaks before you add the evaporated milk, as I find the eggs harder to stir when swimming in liquid.</li>
                <li>Stir and do not whisk to prevent from aerating the custard mixture and adding too much bubbles.</li>
                <li>Straining the mixture using a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth is the secret to super smooth Leche flan.</li>
                <li>If there are many bubbles in the mixture, allow the mixture to stand for a few minutes for the bubbles to subside, and skim any foam that rises on top.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <p>STEPS<p>
                <li>Blend lime zest, lime juice, mango halves, and the salt in a blender until smoothened.</li>
                <li>Heat gelatin and 1/2 water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the mango puree. Pour jelly in. Carefully add remaining mangoes and stir to combine.
                Cover jelly tightly.</li>
                <li>FLAN: place a rack in the middle of the oven preheated to 350. Cook sugar and 1 tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then cook alone, in a swirling pan occassionally.</li>
                <li> Whisk egg yolks, coconut milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into loaf pan with caramel. Cover with foil. Set inside a roasting pan and place on oven rack. Carefully pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of loaf pan (a tea kettle makes this easy if you have one).</li>
                <li>Bake flan until just set in the center (it should still wobble a little when gently jiggled) and barely golden on top, 55–60 minutes. Let cool (still covered), then chill until cold, at least 4 hours. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <p>Corn assembly</p>
                <li>Spread out corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle sugar and salt over, then drizzle oil over and toss to combine. Roast until crisped slightly but not yet browned and a little sticky, 12–15 minutes. Let cool.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring sago pearls and ½ cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook until translucent and firm-tender, 8–10 minutes. Drain, then combine in a small bowl with coconut milk, stirring well to separate pearls. Let cool.</li>
                <li>Toast coconut in a small skillet over medium heat until edges start to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes exactly</li>
                <li>Cut flan into 1"pieces and divide some among tall glasses or wide bowls. Cut out mango jelly into desired shapes and arrange on top, then spoon in ice cream, condensed milk, shaved ice, strawberries, macapuno, palm seeds, corn, sago pearls, toasted coconut, red beans, and pinipig as desired.</li>
